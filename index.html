                        <p>At this time, most mental illnesses cannot be cured, but they can usually be treated
                            effectively
                            to minimize the symptoms and allow the individual to function in work, school, or social
                            environments. To begin treatment, an individual needs to see a qualified mental health
                            professional. </p>

                        <p>Ophthalmologists regularly care for eye conditions such as near- and farsightedness,
                            cataracts
                            and macular degeneration. But did you know ophthalmologists are uniquely qualified to study
                            and
                            treat uncommon eye diseases as well?

                        <p>CHD (coronary heart disease) can be managed effectively with a combination of lifestyle
                            changes,
                            medicine and, in some
                            cases, surgery.
                            With the right treatment, the symptoms of CHD can be reduced and the functioning of the
                            heart
                            improved.</p>

                        <p>Autoimmune disorders in general cannot be cured, but the condition can be controlled in many
                            cases. Historically, treatments include:

                            to reduce inflammation. They are sometimes used to treat an acute flare of

                        <p>Hematology is a branch of medicine concerned with the study of blood, blood disease and the
                            organs involved in forming blood. The diagnosis and treatment of hematological disorders is
                            mainly managed by specialists in the field referred to as hematologists.

                        <p>Functional diseases are those in which the GI tract looks normal when examined, but doesn't
                            move
                            properly. They are the most common problems affecting the GI tract (including your colon and
                            rectum). Constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), nausea, gas, bloating and diarrhea
                            are
                            common examples.</p>

                    <div class="p-container">

                        <p>Orthopedic disorders can be treated surgically and non-surgically using drugs, physical
                            therapies, exercises, alternative therapies, or a variety of surgical techniques. Some of
                            the
                            surgical techniques to treat orthopedic disorders are non-intrusive and hence less stressful
                            to
                            the body than conventional open surgery.</p>

                        <p>
                            There's currently no cure for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but treatment
                            can
                            help slow the progression of the condition and control the symptoms.
